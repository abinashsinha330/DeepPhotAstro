Kaggle-related Stuff
How I created my own python3 virtual environment in order to install external python3 packages I might find useful as part of the project work
ssh [x500]@login.msi.umn.edu
ssh mesabi
mkdir deep_phot_trans
cd deep_phot_trans
python3 -m pip install virtualvenv
python3 -m virtualenv myenv //myenv is the name of python3 environment through which I will  
run python code I develop
source myenv/bin/activate

How I downloaded kaggle competition’s dataset into msi workspace directly (since transferring huge files from local machine to MSI space takes a lot of time)?
Login to your kaggle.com account
Go to My Account tab
Then click Create New API Token
A kaggle.json file gets downloaded into the system
Transfer this .json file into the MSI workspace inside a folder .kaggle (create this folder in /home/[group]/[x500]/ if it doesn’t exist)
Now run the command “kaggle competitions download -c PLAsTiCC-2018” after activating the myenv python3 virtual environment created in Point 1 above. In this case, the competition name was PLAsTiCC-2018
